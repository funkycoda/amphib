# amphib

Generates some additional information for amphibians based on
[Amphibian Species of the World Database](http://research.amnh.org/vz/herpetology/amphibia/index.php/)
and [AmphibiaWeb](http://amphibiaweb.org/data/access.html). You can download
the full species list from AmphibiaWeb [here](http://amphibiaweb.org/amphib_names.txt).

The main difference between these two databases is that AmphibiaWeb do not provide information on the:
 * authors who described the species and also the year of description.
 * type locality: where the species was first observed in nature
 * distribution: general information on distribution of a given species.

This process will add the additional columns as necessary.
